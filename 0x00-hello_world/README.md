Build steps in c
Preprocessor: The C Preprocessor is not a part of the compiler, but is a separate step in the compilation process. In simple terms, a C Preprocessor is just a text substitution tool and it instructs the compiler to do required pre-processing before the actual compilation. We’ll refer to the C Preprocessor as CPP.

Write a script that runs a C file through the preprocessor and save the result into another file.

The C file name will be saved in the variable $CFILE
The output should be saved in the file c
#!/bin/bash
gcc -E $CFILE > c

Compiler
The code which is expanded by the preprocessor is passed to the compiler. The compiler converts this code into assembly code. Or we can say that the C compiler converts the pre-processed code into assembly code.

Write a script that compiles a C file but does not link.

The C file name will be saved in the variable $CFILE
The output file should be named the same as the C file, but with the extension .o instead of .c.
Example: if the C file is main.c, the output file should be main.o
#!/bin/bash

gcc -c $CFILE > ${CFILE::-2}”.o”

Assembler
The assembly code is converted into object code by using an assembler. The name of the object file generated by the assembler is the same as the source file. The extension of the object file in DOS is ‘.obj,’ and in UNIX, the extension is ‘o’. If the name of the source file is ‘hello.c’, then the name of the object file would be ‘hello.obj’.

Write a script that generates the assembly code of a C code and save it in an output file.

The C file name will be saved in the variable $CFILE
The output file should be named the same as the C file, but with the extension .s instead of .c.
Example: if the C file is main.c, the output file should be main.s
#!/bin/bash
gcc -S $CFILE > ${CFILE::-2}”.s”

Linker
Mainly, all the programs written in C use library functions. These library functions are pre-compiled, and the object code of these library files is stored with ‘.lib’ (or ‘.a’) extension. The main working of the linker is to combine the object code of library files with the object code of our program. Sometimes the situation arises when our program refers to the functions defined in other files; then linker plays a very important role in this. It links the object code of these files to our program. Therefore, we conclude that the job of the linker is to link the object code of our program with the object code of the library files and other files. The output of the linker is the executable file. The name of the executable file is the same as the source file but differs only in their extensions. In DOS, the extension of the executable file is ‘.exe’, and in UNIX, the executable file can be named as ‘a.out’. For example, if we are using printf() function in a program, then the linker adds its associated code in an output file.

Write a script that compiles a C file and creates an executable named cisfun.

The C file name will be saved in the variable $CFILE
#!/bin/bash
gcc -o cisfun $CFILE
